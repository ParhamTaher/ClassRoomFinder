# Demo Video Script:

## Introduction (40-45s):

We've all been in situations where we had difficulty finding spaces for personal or group work and, as of right now, our university doesn't offer a comprehensive and centralized solution to address this problem. Currently, we can reserve special study rooms in advance in buildings like Robarts and Bahen, individually look up lecture timings for each room, or check rooms one-by-one to find an available one.

Our app steps in to provide University of Toronto students and faculty with a quick and easy way to find free spaces (lecture halls, classrooms, etc.) that they can use to study, play, work, or find others who are doing similar activities.

In this video, we'll be showing you a quick demo of the functionality of our web app, DiscoverUofT. Our front-end is incomplete so we'll be demonstrating the functionality of the app through our mockups. We'll see how a typical user would interact with our app and showcase its basic functionality.

## Demonstration:

### User One:

We’ll start by looking at what is likely the most common scenario. Alex is a computer science student who is looking for somewhere to work on an assignment with his friends.

Upon opening the web-app, he can see a map of his location displaying nearby buildings along with a list view of the buildings. You can see that the labels provide information about the number of available/total classrooms and the closing time. Here he can see the Bahen Centre has some availability so he will select that building.

Once he has chosen Bahen Centre, he can browse through a list of rooms inside. Here he selects a room, BA3195, and is provided with information regarding ongoing or upcoming lectures, tutorials, user events, and user comments. There is nothing going on right now so they head over to the room.

### User Two:

The second user, Jenny, is a returning user. She is working on the same assignment herself and is hoping to collaborate with students in the same class. In our app, although first-time users can only see nearby buildings or search through all of them, users can bookmark their favourite buildings for convenience. She prefers to work in the labs at the Bahen Centre so she goes to her favourites tab and selects Bahen. While browsing available classrooms inside the Bahen Centre, Jenny can filter rooms by their event description or tags so she searches for her class, CSC301, and is able to locate a group working in room 3195. Now that she has found what she is looking for, Jenny can head to BA 3195 and join Alex and his friends to work on the assignment.

### User Three:

Let’s look at our final use case with Phil. While he’s walking past Bahen, Phil decides to pull up the app and see if anything’s going on. In the comments section, he sees someone mention that there are free cookies being provided at the ongoing job fair and decides to go grab some. Since he’s already there, Phil decides to see if his favourite room, BA3195, is free so he can get some work done. Unfortunately, Phil sees that the room is taken and decides to not study instead since he hates every other room in Bahen.

## Conclusion:

Over the last few examples, we’ve seen how both single users and groups can utilize our app to not only quickly find free spaces that fit their needs, but also keep up with ongoing events happening in buildings around them..

For the next iteration, our goal is to end with a minimum viable product which will perform all of the basic functionality. As such, our focus will be on developing the front end, integrating the backend to allow for basic functionality, and developing additional features such as room filtering and integrating the Google Image API.
