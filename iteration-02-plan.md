#### Artifacts

* Members will maintain personal to-do lists and schedules of upcoming deadlines. This will be synchronized with a group to-do list which is easily available in the Facebook group chat or on Discord, updated frequently.
* The group task board will comprise of 3 sections:
	* Red Section - requires immediate attention/completion.
	* Yellow Section - requires completion throughout the week.
	* Green Section - may complete whenever free time is available or may be indefinitely postponed. 
* Overall, scrum master will coordinate and ensure that tasks are being completed by the deadlines for submission.
* Tasks are assigned to group members for completion at every Sunday meeting and reviewed at Thursday meetings. 

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Organize code sprints for the following week.
 	* Allowing the group to get ahead of the deadlines and begin development as soon as possible to maximize the quality of the final project.

#### Artifacts

To present the project idea the following items will be produced:

* Demo video - a video showcasing the features, interface and user interactiosn of the project. This will allow viewers to get a feel for the completed project and generate excitement for compeltion. 
* Final front-end mockups - along with the video these mockups will provide a more hands-on presentation of the projection to be shown as slides as well as distributed hard copies during the presentatiion period.
* Entity Relationship Diagrams - displaying these diagrams ensures that persons can be aware of the final user and how the information will be stored and processed in order to present a clean final product to their screens.
