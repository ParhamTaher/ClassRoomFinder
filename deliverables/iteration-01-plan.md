# TEAM 26 - Team AWESOME

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Thursday 26 January 2017
 * End date: Thursday 9 February 2017

## Process

Our first two meetings served several purposes. These included group formation, idea brain storming as well as the beginning of all planning for the project. After pitching several ideas amongst ourselves we decided that the one that would be optimal and most fulfilling would be the idea including providing a solution to the problem of finding empty classrooms and fields on the University of Toronto campus for studying, meetings and general school-related activities. We identified that there was no current easy alternative to this problem which plagued students on a regular basis. In our opinion, this idea would be greatly appreciated by the student population and add substantial value their everyday lives. 

#### Roles & Responsibilities

Team Leader / Scrum Master: Jaleel Grant
Backend: Ishawant Sodhi, Angela Ruiz, Jaleel Grant
Full Stack: Shray Sharma, Parham Taher
Database: Nicky Hunter
Frontend and Visuals: Bence Linder

These are given primarily as a guideline for the future of the project. However, group members may work on/be required to work on several aspects of the overall product as needed.

#### Events

 * Plans made to have a general meeting every Thursday in tutorial. As well as several other weekly meetings.
 * A Facebook group was created where group members discuss various topics pertaining to the project and their contributions. 
 * It was decided that after completion of the planning stages, a few weeks of intense coding will occur where we plan to dive deep into the project, completing as much as we can in order to use the later weeks for reviewing and testing as well as demo preparation.
 * Discord accounts were created by all group members as a means of additional communication for coordination of group activities. 
 * Weekly meetings will take place in person at tutorials and the others at scheduled locations and times throughout the week as discussed in the Facebook group. 
 * Sunday meetings on Facebook/Discord will act as progress report meetings where each member will be required to state what they are working on, what they plan to work on along with what they completed during the past week. This will prevent members from falling behind and/or be delayed by difficulties they may face. If serious difficulties are being experienced by a member, other members may pitch in and help with that component. 

#### Artifacts

* Members will maintain personal to-do lists and schedules of upcoming deadlines. This will be synchronized with a group to-do list easily available in the Facebook group chat or on Discord, updated frequently.
* Overall, scrum master will coordinate and ensure that tasks are being completed by the deadlines for submission.
* The group task board will comprise of 3 sections:
	* Red Section - requires immediate attention/completion.
	* Yellow Section - requires completion throughout the week.
	* Green Section - may complete whenever free time is available or may be indefinitely postponed. 
* Tasks are assigned to group members for completion at every Sunday meeting and reviewed at Thursday meetings. 


## Product

#### Goals and Tasks

 * Finalize planning and submit Team Deliverable 1.
 	* This requires full completion of the required documents, review and discussion by the group.
 * Organize code sprints for the following week.
 	* These will allow the group to get ahead of the deadlines and begin development as soon as possible to maximize the quality of the final project.
 * Discuss with other students outside of the group about features and add-ons that may enhance the product. 
 * Submit Team Deliverable 1.
 * Setup group repository and ensure that everyone has access.

#### Artifacts

 * Mock-ups will be produced and added along with the first deliverable outlining a rough draft of the interface and screens that will be available to users. This allows for better visualization of the final project as well as allows TAs to get an understanding of our aims.
 * Data sources identified and explored to determine the best ways in which information can be extracted and used for the project. Several sources were identified in previous meetings. We intend to present these in the next tutorial along with other interim artifacts produced.
 * Determine an easily remembered fun name for the title of the product as well as decide on and develop the logo.
