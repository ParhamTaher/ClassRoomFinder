## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 2 2017
 * Where: BA2195

## Process - Reflection

We received the results of our questionnaire and reflected on the results.

The questionnaire revealed that students either use mobile or websites to 
keep track of university notifications, which is good because our application
is website based, meaning that it can be displayed on both website and mobile
platforms. 

The questionnaire also revealed that 70% of students have group work, and that 
75% of them meet 1-2 times a week. These groups tend to be 3-4 people in size 
and students also tend to meet on campus.

62.5% of students encounter difficulty finding places to study on campus that 
can accommodate their group size. Also, 60% of students participate in group
sports or recreational activities. A whopping 75% of these students ecounter 
difficulty finding recreational spaces on campus that can accommodate their group 
size.

70% of students utilize empty classrooms to study alone or in groups.
50% have been interrupted by incoming students/lecture times while utilizing an 
empty classroom.

Lastly, 77.8% of students would use an application to help find free spaces on 
campus. The results of our questionnaire definitely indicated a need for
our application.



#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Everyone seems content with their role. Those who enjoy working with backend technologies are 
 assigned to the backend, and those that enjoy frontend work are assigned to the frontend.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * One of our group members dropped the course. We had assigned database work to
 this person, which meant that we had to re-organize our group member roles 
 and functions to accommodate the loss of this group member.
 * All of the members of the group have been busier than anticipated. The individual 
 assignments for this course seem to be taking much more time to complete than previously
 thought. This has impacted group member contributions to the course project.


#### Planned changes
 * Group members were not able to meet on Sundays. Instead, our group meets for one hour
 a week on Thursdays in tutorial.
 * The database work that had been assigned to our group member that dropped the course
 has been reassigned to Bence.
 * We have not been programming as much as we had hoped for in the last iteration plan.
 * We learned that only basic functionality is required for the March 10 deadline. Hence, 
 we will only implement basic functionality by that date. 
 * The website front end is going to have three tabs entitled: "Home", "Near Me", "Open Near Me"


## Product - Review

 Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YfwOuJoAavPKs1ViHwh4KxzeTWRXFWZJYdI62TvnkkI/edit?usp=sharing
 * The front end design was finalized.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * The database work that had been assigned to the group member that dropped the course was
 not completed. The group member was not present to complete the task.
 * Not all group members are attending meetings.
 * Group members were not able to meet in person on Sundays.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * We are going to have group meetings online once per week in addition to the group meetings on Thursdays
 to discuss code progress. Hopefully holding the meeting online will be more accessible to the group members.
 * More group member engagement in coding.
