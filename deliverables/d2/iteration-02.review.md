# TEAM AWESOME


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 2 2017
 * Where: BA2195

## Process - Reflection

We received the results of our questionnaire and reflected on the results.

The questionnaire revealed that students either use mobile or websites to 
keep track of university notifications, which is good because our application
is website based, meaning that it can be displayed on both website and mobile
platforms. 

The questionnaire also revealed that 70% of students have group work, and that 
75% of them meet 1-2 times a week. These groups tend to be 3-4 people in size 
and students also tend to meet on campus.

62.5% of students encounter difficulty finding places to study on campus that 
can accommodate their group size. Also, 60% of students participate in group
sports or recreational activities. A whopping 75% of these students encounter 
difficulty finding recreational spaces on campus that can accommodate their group 
size.

70% of students utilize empty classrooms to study alone or in groups.
50% have been interrupted by incoming students/lecture times while utilizing an 
empty classroom.

Lastly, 77.8% of students would use an application to help find free spaces on 
campus. The results of our questionnaire indicated a need for
our application.



#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Everyone seems content with their role. Those who enjoy working with backend technologies are 
 assigned to the backend, and those that enjoy frontend work are assigned to the frontend. 
 * We came up with a temporary name for our web-app. We will call it DiscoverUofT. This name can be expanded to other universities, if needed. For example, DiscoverYorkU, DiscoverRyU, etc. This name makes sense since our app allows the user to find lecture-slots, drop-in times, schedules, and empty classrooms/fields, hence using the word discover.
 * We began to start keeping [minutes](artifacts/minutes/march 9) of every meeting. This ensure that group members could easily be reminded of what was discussed in meetings as well as those who were unable to attend could be notified of developments. 


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * One of our group members dropped the course. We had assigned database work to this person, which meant that we had to re-organize our group member roles and functions to accommodate the loss of this group member. This created a minor setback in the completion of tasks for other group members.
 * All members of the group have been busier than anticipated. The individual assignments for this course seem to be taking much more time to complete than previously thought. This has impacted group member contributions to the course project. Additionally, other courses with midterms and group projects have slashed the allocation of time available for this project. 


#### Planned changes
 * Group members were not able to meet on Sunday. Instead, our group met for one hour on Thursday in tutorial and discussed more material than planned, going over the original tutorial period. 
 * The database work that had been assigned to our group member that dropped the course has been reassigned to Jaleel.
 * We have not been programming as much as we had hoped for in the last iteration plan. We are changing this for the current iteration. 
 * We learned that only basic functionality is required for the March 10 deadline. Hence, 
 we will only implement basic functionality by that date. 
 * The website front end is going to have three tabs entitled: "Home", "Near Me", "Open Near Me"
 * For the booking system, instead of implementing a log in system that requires a username and
 password, we are going to implement a system that writes a message upon a user click that indicates
 a room is occupied. This would make the booking system faster and much easier to use.
 * Shray/Bence will provide the voice over for the video.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * The questionnaire was completed. 
 Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YfwOuJoAavPKs1ViHwh4KxzeTWRXFWZJYdI62TvnkkI/edit?usp=sharing
 * The front end design was finalized.
 * Backend functionality and routes implemented [here](backend/).
 * Database structured and sample data added and [ERDs](artifacts/ERD.pdf) created.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Not all group members are attending meetings.
 * Intended to complete the entire front-end by the end of the current iteration but settled for the required functionality shown in the [mockups](desktop mockups/img). We will complete the entire front-end by the next iteration instead.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * We are going to have group meetings online three times per week in addition to the group meetings on Thursdays to discuss code progress and project completion. Hopefully holding the meeting online will be more accessible to the group members.
 * More group member engagement in coding.
 * Optimize GitHub workflow and make sure commits and being shared for those working in groups.
