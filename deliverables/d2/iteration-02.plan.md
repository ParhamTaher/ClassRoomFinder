# TEAM 26 - Team AWESOME

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Thursday 16 February 2017
 * End date: Thursday 9 March 2017

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & Responsibilities

**Team Leader / Scrum Master:** Jaleel Grant 

* Ensures that deadlines are met are responsibilities fulfilled. Reminds group of meetings, expectations etc.

**Backend:** Ishawant Sodhi, Angela Ruiz, Jaleel Grant

* For this period, they will be concerned with the basic routing of the backend. This will include providing skeleton methods, connections to APIs, dummy inserts as well as beginning with the use of JDBC to connect the database.

**Full Stack:** Shray Sharma, Parham Taher

* Assists with all sections, completing prescribed tasks and ensuring that all areas of the project are nearing being completed as expected.  

**Database:** Jaleel Grant

* For this stage, providing the database for our group includes coming up with Entity Relationship Diagrams followed by creation fo the schema by the prescribed date. 

**Frontend and Visuals:** Bence Linder, Shray Sharma

* Creation and maintenance of the final front end mockups and video demo presentation for submission three days before the due date to handle any unexpected errors.

These are given primarily as a guideline for the future of the project. However, group members may work on/be required to work on several aspects of the overall product as needed.

#### Events

 * In-person meeting Thursday 16th February in BA2195 where we outlined to-do lists as well as the tasks each member should complete or be completing during the reading week break.
 * Online meeting on Sunday 19th February. This meeting is to discuss the to-do list and expectations of each member for the reading week.
 * Online meeting on Tuesday 21st February. This meeting's purpose included discussion of tasks to be conpleted by this date as well as the synchronization of tasks and subgroups.
 * Wednesday 22nd February meeting of Ishwant and Jaleel in Bahen to begin to work on connections for the backend. 
 * Online meeting Sunday 26th February. Preparations for the upcoming week are to be discussed along with the progress report of all ongoing assignments by each group member. 
 * In-person meeting Thursday 2nd March. In this meeting progress reports will be given, front end mockups looked at and discussed for changes and prepartions for submisison for the next phase outlined. Here we will do our review meeting and begin the next phase of the project.
 * In-person Wednesday 8th March meetings of backend and frontend groups to finalize their respective contribution. These took place in Bahen.
 * In-person meeting Thursday 9th March. In this meeting we discussed progress reports and submission as well as plans and adjustments for the future. 


#### Artifacts

* Members will maintain personal to-do lists and schedules of upcoming deadlines. This will be synchronized with a [group to-do list](artifacts/to-do-list [march 9]) which is easily available in the Facebook group chat or on Discord, updated frequently.
* The group task board will comprise of 3 sections:
	* Red Section - requires immediate attention/completion.
	* Yellow Section - requires completion throughout the week.
	* Green Section - may complete whenever free time is available or may be indefinitely postponed. 
* Overall, scrum master will coordinate and ensure that tasks are being completed by the deadlines for submission.
* Tasks are assigned to group members for completion at every Sunday meeting and reviewed at Thursday meetings. 
* [Progress Reports](artifacts/progress_report.txt) produced and published displaying tasks and what stage they were at with respect to completion.
* [Draft to-do lists](artifacts/draft to-do-list [march 2].png) createdd rougly by Jaleel at meetings and discussions and transferred to [professional artifacts](artifacts/to-do-list [march 9]) at later times.


#### Git / GitHub workflow

We're using a pretty simple (and common) GitHub workflow. We chose this workflow because it's a very simple process but still effective. As a result, it's easy for team members to learn the process and hard for us to make mistakes resulting in less conflicts, rollbacks, etc.

* The master branch is always stable, everything in it must be tested and working, it should always be safe to branch off of or deploy.
* When working on something new, team members must create a descriptively named branch off of master (e.g. search-buildings-page).
* Commit to this branch on your local machine but still push your work to the same branch in the team repo. This makes sure our work is always backed up and, since we don't have to worry about master being affected, it won't cause confusion with another member's code.
* If in need of feedback or help, open a pull request highlighting the issue and other members can offer tips/guidance. If you think you're finished and are ready to merge, open a pull request (or use the one above if applicable) and state that you think you're finished.
* After at least one other member has reviewed the pull request and signed off on it, you can merge the branch into master. Signing off can be anything from "Looks good." or a "+1" as long as it's clear that the reviewer has approved it.

Github has really streamlined our development process, especially since we have 6 total group members, it is hard to manage without it. Its very useful as we can easily see other peoples progress and see what they have been working on. The master branch will always have a working copy, so every group member has access to the main project and can pull changes to their local machine and start working right away. The master branch will always be kept clean as each group member works on their own separate branch and only merge what is working. Another benefit we have noticed is if for example a group member is stuck on a particular part of the project, he or she can open a pull request to receive help.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Finalize planning and submit Team Deliverable 2.
 * Organize code sprints for the following week.
 	* Allowing the group to get ahead of the deadlines and begin development as soon as possible to maximize the quality of the final project.
 * Prepare compiled data from the questionnaire completed and distributed during reading week.
 * Create demo scrips.
 * Practice demo video before recording.
 * Record demo video and have the required additional artifacts for submission.
 * Submit Team Deliverable 2.

#### Artifacts

To present the project idea the following items will be produced:

* [Demo video](video) - a video showcasing the features, interface and user interactiosn of the project. This will allow viewers to get a feel for the completed project and generate excitement for compeltion. 
* [Final front-end mockups](artifacts/Desktop Mockup/DesktopMockup.png) - along with the video these mockups will provide a more hands-on presentation of the projection to be shown as slides as well as distributed hard copies during the presentatiion period.
* [Schema](backend/db.sql) - organization of relations and field in them
* [Entity Relationship Diagrams](artifacts/ERD.pdf) - displaying these diagrams ensures that persons can be aware of the final user and how the information will be stored and processed in order to present a clean final product to their screens.
