Meeting Minutes

- Despite the fact that many group members had been busier than we anticipated, we managed to create the backend just in time
- We have a running server connected to a database 
- We are hosting the server on Heroku
- We still need to create the UI, which shouldn't take long
- We settled on FluidUI, which has a free version
- The ERD diagrams that had been assigned to our group member that dropped the course have been reassigned to Jaleel, who finished them
- We have been using Facebook messenger to communicate. The group members prefer this 
to meeting in person.
