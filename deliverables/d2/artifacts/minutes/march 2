- Things have not gone as well as we hoped. 
- One of our group members dropped
the course and all of the other group members have been busier than anticipated
with other assignments.
- We have not set aside enough time for this project.
- We need to investigate UI tools and find one appropiate for our application

- We are going to work hard during the next week to create a working prototype. We have assigned roles to each group member.
