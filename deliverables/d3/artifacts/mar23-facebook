- Maybe we should add room capacity?
- We also have to differentiate between a room and lecture hall
- also for the submenu of selecting a buidling, maybe we should have rooms, labs, lecture halls rather than rooms, bookings, comments?
- Angela had trouble populating the database
- Shray was able to get the Google Maps API woroking!!
- Shray was able to get Galbraith, Bahen and McLennan on the map
- The app has better visuals
- Parham and Shray decided to make a few changes from the mock-up to speed up our work
