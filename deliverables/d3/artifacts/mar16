March 16 minutes

- Parham, Angela, Jaleel and Ishwant attended.
- we need to decide how much each group is going to contribute programming-wise
- We have to do the html front-end
- none of our group members are keen on working on front-end
- we need html/css and then we have to connect them to backend
- Parham thinks he can make a React template
- if we can set the toolbar at the top the rest should be easy
- Sunday night -> have a Facebook video chat
	- Everyone needs to be on the call
	- Parham says the template will be ready by then
	- Hopefully we can come up with a basic routing
	- Monday will start on front-end and back-end will continue
- figure out how to send http requests
- we showed the TA our video and he liked it
- We plan to meet on Monday March 20 between 2:00 PM - 9:00 PM to have a programming sprint. 
- Angela can only meet from 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM
- Let's go over some of the routes
	- search buildings will need the map plugin
	- front page will need the map plugin
	- Parham doesn't know how to get the Google API
	- Ishwant will figure this out
	- Need favourite buildings, building information need to be added to a database
	- We can spoof some of the data
	- Parham has to figure out how his code will work with the backend
- Ishwant can do the backend in about two days
- get nearby buildings will be a post request, will send user ID
	- have geolocation set as the header in the post request
	- We should have users, having favourites would make it unecessarily complicated. 
	- get all buildings - GET request
- Get building info - will be a post request
- input will be building id, output will be everything from that database
- Computer Labs - are there a finite number of these on campus? Is the number small enough to hardcode this number?
