# TEAM AWESOME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 23, 2017 from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
 * Where: BA2195

## Process - Reflection

Overall, this iteration was much smoother than the last. 

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * We got the frontend and backend running running in time.
 * We have the basic structure for all the HTTP requests.
 * We managed to finish everything on time. 
 * We haven't had any hiccups in terms of time management for this iteration. 
 This is a vast improvement from the last iteration.
 * Everyone seems to gotten used to the GitHub workflow.
 * The decision to put Ishwant in control of the pull requests was sucessful in avoiding conflicts.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * We are having trouble connecting the frontend to the backend.
 * We divided the work into two parts, frontend and backend. We are finding that this wasn't a good design decision.
 Dividing the work in this manner made connecting the front end to the back end overtly complex.
 * This resulted in unnecessary troubleshooting.
 * Ishwant created asynchronous calls to the database. Parham and Angela are unfamiliar with this method of 
 database connectivity.
 * We are having a lot of trouble using Google Maps API
 * We are deciding to scrap it.
 * React was too hard to learn, we wanted to learn it for the project but we did not have time to learn it.
 It was not developer friendly.
 * 


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * We have decided to add a login.
 * Instead of using cookies we're going to use a login system, this will 
 make keeping track of favourites much easier
 * Unfortunately, we are going to limit the features of the Google Maps API.
 Right now, it's not a high priority. It is not needed to meet the requirements of the 
 next deliverable.



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Goal: Finish the frontend HTML/CSS
 	- This was completed by Parham
 	- [link to artifact to show it was completed]
 	- Parham has planned to create a React template

 * Goal: Popluate the database
 	- This was accomplished by Angela

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Goal: Google Maps integration
 	- This was not completed
 	- Our developers found learning the Google Maps API more difficult than expected
 	- Our developers wanted to learn the Google Maps API, however were not
 	able to given time constraints
 	- We had to look into other map alternatives
 	- This goal wasn't completed due to time constraints

 * Goal: Finish the frontend HTML/CSS
 	- This was completed, however the usage of a React template was abandoned
 	- Parham found the React template way too difficult to learn
 	- More user-friendly alternatives were used instead

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
-----
 * Integration of Google Maps/Other map technology
 	- Despite the fact that the Google Maps API was difficult to learn, our 
 	developers are eager to learn this technology. Our group will continue 
 	to attempt to integrate the Google Maps API into our application. If
 	our group members still cannot integrate the Google Maps API
 	successfully, we still stick to our alternatives.

 * Prepare for the Demo
 	- Many of our group members are not accustomed to presentations
 	- We are going to have a group meeting where we practice our demo
 	- We will create scripts for each group member to ensure the 
 	presentation goes smoothly
