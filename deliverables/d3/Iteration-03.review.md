# TEAM AWESOME


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 23, 2017 from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
 * Where: BA2195

## Process - Reflection

Overall, this iteration was much smoother than the last. Our group members have 
become fully accustomed to the work flow and everyone is contributing. 
Unlike the last iteration, group members worked continuously on this project 
throughout the entire iteration.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * Our decision to abandon the React template was successful. Parham found the
 React template too complicated, and decided to switch to another front-end technology.
 Ultimately, this was a good decision because React isn't user friendly. Our team found it
 much easier to develop the front end without React.


 * The decision to put Ishwant in control of the pull requests was sucessful in avoiding conflicts. We haven't had any GitHub conflicts during this iteration. Ishwant was
 definitely the best group member for this position.

 * Delegating the creation of the server to Ishwant was also a good decision. The group
 found Ishwant's coding style to easy to read. The group did not have trouble adding
 to Ishwant's code.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * We encountered difficulty connecting the frontend to the backend. We had decided to 
 divide our group into two parts: those who worked on the frontend, and those who worked
 on the backend. We found that this wasn't a good design decision. Our group members
 spent too much time troubleshooting issues that arose from frontend - backend
 incompatibility.


 * Our developers had a lot of trouble learning the Google Maps API. At one point, we were
 ready to abandon the Google Maps API altogether and look for alternatives. Thankfully,
 Shray was able to implement basic Google Maps functionality in the homepage the night 
 before the deadline. Although we did manage to figure out the Google Maps API, we felt
 our implementation of this feature came too close to the deadline. We underestimated
 the complexity of this feature.

 * We had to abandon React. We found this technology too hard to learn and not 
 user-friendly. Although we did find a solution for this issue, we should have 
 initialized the frontend with more user-friendly technology to avoid wasting
 time.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * We have decided to add a login. Instead of using cookies we're going to use a login system. This will make keeping track of favourites much easier.

 * Unfortunately, we are going to limit the features of the Google Maps API.
 Right now, it's not a high priority. It is not needed to meet the requirements of the 
 upcoming deliverable.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Goal: Google Maps integration
	- Basic functionality of this feature was completed the night of March 23
	- Only the homepage has Google Maps integration
	- Although we only have basic funcionality completed, we were very proud
	of achieving this goal.
	- Our developers found it difficult to use the Google Maps API.
	- We were very close to abandoning the use of the Google Maps API.
	- Thankfully, we were able to get basic functionality working.

 * Goal: Finish the frontend HTML/CSS
 	- This was completed by Parham
 	- [link to artifact to show it was completed]

 * Goal: Popluate the database
 	- This was accomplished by various group members.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Goal: Google Maps integration
 	- Full functionality of this feature was not completed
 	- Our developers found learning the Google Maps API more difficult than expected
 	- Our developers wanted to learn the Google Maps API, however were not
 	able to given time constraints
 	- We had to look into other map alternatives
 	- We were only able to implement basic functionality.
 	- We had originally planned for full functionaity of this feature.

 * Goal: Finish the frontend HTML/CSS
 	- This was completed, however the usage of a React template was abandoned.
 	- Parham found the React template too difficult to learn given 
 	time constraints.
 	- More user-friendly alternatives were used instead.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Integration of Google Maps/Other map technology
 	- Despite the fact that the Google Maps API was difficult to learn, our 
 	developers are eager to learn this technology. Our group will continue 
 	to integrate the Google Maps API into our application. 

 * Prepare for the Demo
 	- Many of our group members are not accustomed to presentations.
 	- We are going to have a group meeting where we practice our demo.
 	- We will create scripts for each group member to ensure the 
 	presentation goes smoothly.
