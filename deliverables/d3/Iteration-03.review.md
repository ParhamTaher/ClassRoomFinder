## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 23, 2017 from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
 * Where: BA2195

## Process - Reflection

Overall, this iteration was much smoother than the last. Our group members have
become fully accustomed to the work flow, deliverables and deadlines and everyone is contributing. Unlike the last iteration, group members worked continuously on this project
throughout the entire iteration and faced only minor challenges due to time constraints and other course material.

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * We got the front-end and backend running completed for submission.
 * We have the basic structure for all the HTTP requests.
 * We haven't had any hiccups in terms of time management for this iteration. This is a vast improvement from the last iteration.
 * The decision to put Ishwant in control of the pull requests was successful in avoiding conflicts.
 * Google maps API looks great and is now fully functional.
 * Backend endpoints are being hit and producing all the required and expected results for use in the front-end pages as well as use in the last iteration for application completion.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Splitting front-end and backend development into two groups proves challenging when files have to be integrated and/or merged.
 * Ishwant created asynchronous calls to the database. Parham and Angela are unfamiliar with some of this method of database connectivity and backend development.
 * We began attempting to use React as our front-end framework. This proved unsuccessful as React has a very high learning curve and we were unable to acquire the necessary skills in the short amount of time required for the project. This led to the development using just Node JS and Express with a Rest


#### Planned changes

 * We have decided to add a login instead of using cookies for user information as originally planned. This will provide an easier way to track user favorites and preferences within the application.
 * We now have a strict 2-day deadline where all deliverables from subgroups must be delivered to the main group forum at least 2 days before submission deadline. This will allow for review by group members as well as a grace period for unexpected issues.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Goal: Google Maps integration
	- Basic functionality of this feature was completed. Although we only have basic functionality completed, we were very proud of achieving this goal.

 * Goal: Finish the [front-end](../assets/) HTML/CSS
 	- This was completed by Parham, Shray and Bence

 * Goal: Populate the database
 	- This was accomplished by Angela and will be continued when the Cobalt API is integrated to populate the application.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Goal: Google Maps integration
 	- Full functionality of this feature was not completed
 	- Our developers found learning the Google Maps API more difficult than expected
 	- Our developers wanted to learn the Google Maps API, however were not
 	able to given time constraints
 	- We had to look into other map alternatives
 	- We were only able to implement basic functionality.
 	- We had originally planned for full functionality of this feature.

 * Goal: Finish the front-end HTML/CSS
 	- This was completed, however the usage of a React template was abandoned.
 	- Parham found the React template too difficult to learn given
 	time constraints.
 	- More user-friendly alternatives were used instead.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Better integration of Google Maps/Other map technology
 	- Despite the fact that the Google Maps API was difficult to learn, our
 	developers are eager to learn this technology. Our group will continue
 	to integrate the Google Maps API into our application.

 * Prepare for the final presentation
 	- Many of our group members are not accustomed to presentations.
 	- We are going to have a group meeting where we practice our presentation.
 	- We will create scripts for each group member to ensure the
 	presentation goes smoothly. Scripts will eventually be memorized to prevent dependency on paper and loss of eye contact with professor.
