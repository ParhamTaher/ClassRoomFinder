 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 23, 2017 from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
 * Where: BA2195

## Process - Reflection

Overall, this iteration was much smoother than the last. 

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * We got the frontend and backend running running in time.
 * We have the basic structure for all the HTTP requests.
 * We managed to finish everything on time. 
 * We haven't had any hiccups in terms of time management for this iteration. 
 This is a vast improvement from the last iteration.
 * Everyone seems to gotten used to the GitHub workflow.
 * The decision to put Ishwant in control of the pull requests was sucessful in avoiding conflicts.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * We are having trouble connecting the frontend to the backend.
 * We divided the work into two parts, frontend and backend. We are finding that this wasn't a good design decision.
 Dividing the work in this manner made connecting the front end to the back end overtly complex.
 * This resulted in unnecessary troubleshooting.
 * Ishwant created asynchronous calls to the database. Parham and Angela are unfamiliar with this method of 
 database connectivity.
 * We are having a lot of trouble using Google Maps API
 * We are deciding to scrap it.
 * React was too hard to learn, we wanted to learn it for the project but we did not have time to learn it.
 It was not developer friendly.
 * 


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * We have decided to add a login.
 * Instead of using cookies we're going to use a login system, this will 
 make keeping track of favourites much easier
 * Unfortunately, we are going to limit the features of the Google Maps API.
 Right now, it's not a high priority. It is not needed to meet the requirements of the 
 next deliverable.



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
