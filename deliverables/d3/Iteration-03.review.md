## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 23, 2017 from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
 * Where: BA2195

## Process - Reflection

Overall, this iteration was much smoother than the last. Our group members have
become fully accustomed to the work flow, deliverables and deadlines and everyone is contributing. Unlike the last iteration, group members worked continuously on this project throughout the entire iteration and faced only minor challenges due to time constraints and other course material.

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * We got the basic functionality in the front-end and backend working and completed for submission.
 * We have the basic structure for all the HTTP requests.
 * We haven't had any hiccups in terms of time management for this iteration. This is a vast improvement from the last iteration.
 * The decision to put Ishwant in control of the pull requests was successful in avoiding conflicts.
 * Google maps API integration looks great and is now fully functional.
 * Backend endpoints are being hit and producing all the required and expected results for use in the front-end pages as well as use in the last iteration for application completion.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Splitting front-end and backend development into two groups proves challenging when files have to be integrated and/or merged.
 * Ishwant created asynchronous calls to the database. Parham and Angela are unfamiliar with some of this method of database connectivity and backend development.
 * We began attempting to use React as our front-end framework. This proved unsuccessful as React has a very high learning curve and we were unable to acquire the necessary skills in the short amount of time required for the project. As a result, we went back to using what we already knew such as NodeJS, Express, JQuery, etc.


#### Planned changes

 * We have decided to add a login instead of using cookies for user information as originally planned. This will provide an easier way to track user favorites and preferences within the application.
 * We now have a strict 2-day deadline where all deliverables from subgroups must be delivered to the main group forum at least 2 days before submission deadline. This will allow for review by group members as well as a grace period for unexpected issues.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Goal: Google Maps integration
	- Basic functionality of this feature was completed. Although we only have basic functionality completed, we're happy to get it finally working.

 * Goal: Finish basic front-end functionality [front-end](../../../../tree/master/assets) HTML/CSS
 	- This was completed by Parham, Shray and Bence

 * Goal: Populate the database
 	- This was accomplished by Angela and will be continued when the Cobalt API is integrated to populate the application.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Goal: Google Maps integration
 	- We were only able to implement a basic map where markers are placed according to the building list.
 	- The Google Maps API was a bit frustrating to use and get working as expected so we did not have time to completely implement every feature we had in mind for the map.

 * Goal: Finish the front-end
 	- This was mostly completed, however the usage of a React template was abandoned.
 	- Our front-end team found the React library too difficult and complex to learn and implement well given time constraints.
 	- Used JQuery for UI instead.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main goals/insights are:

* Better integration of Google Maps technology
 	- Now that we've become comfortable with the basic API, we'll continue
 	to integrate the Google Maps API into our application and extend its functionality with more complex features.

* Populating database through Cobalt
    - For this phase, we've been manually populating the database with information about buildings, timings, etc. For the final product, we will aim to integrate Cobalt's API into our application so we have real data.

* Prepare for the final presentation
 	- We are going to have a group meeting where we practice our presentation.
 	- We will create scripts for each group member to ensure the
 	presentation goes smoothly. 
    - Scripts will eventually be memorized to prevent dependency on paper and increase confidence during presentation.
