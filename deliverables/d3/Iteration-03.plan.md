# TEAM AWESOME



## Iteration 3

 * Start date: March 16 2017
 * End date: March 23 2017

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

* Creation of documentation
In our last iteration, we neglected the creation of documentation. We forgot 
to assign someone to oversee the upkeep of the Iteration-03.plan.md and 
Iteration-03.review.md documents. Angela volunteered to fulfill this role. 
Thus, we had to change Angela's role from soley backend role to a
backend/documentation role, and move some of her backend duties to Ishwant.
We had to move some of her backend duties to Ishwant because we realized
documentation is significant time commitment and also that documentation
is worth a considerable portion of our mark. Also, the other group
members will add to the plan and review documents as they see fit. 

We will use our mark on the plan and review documents as a success metric.


#### Roles & responsibilities

**Team Leader / Scrum Master:** Jaleel Grant 

* Ensures that deadlines are met are responsibilities fulfilled. Reminds group of meetings, expectations etc.

**Documentation:** Angela Ruiz

* Oversees creation and editing of Iteration-03.plan.md and 
Iteration-03.review.md documents. Other members are encouraged to add
to the documents but Angela will oversee the entire document creation
process.


**Backend:** Ishawant Sodhi, Angela Ruiz, Jaleel Grant

* For this period, they will be concerned with the basic routing of the backend. This will include providing skeleton methods, connections to APIs, dummy inserts as well as beginning with the use of JDBC to connect the database.

**Full Stack:** Shray Sharma, Parham Taher

* Assists with all sections, completing prescribed tasks and ensuring that all areas of the project are nearing being completed as expected.  

**Database:** Jaleel Grant

* For this stage, providing the database for our group includes coming up with Entity Relationship Diagrams followed by creation fo the schema by the prescribed date. 

**Frontend and Visuals:** Bence Linder, Shray Sharma

* Creation and maintenance of the final front end mockups and video demo presentation for submission three days before the due date to handle any unexpected errors.

These are given primarily as a guideline for the future of the project. However, group members may work on/be required to work on several aspects of the overall product as needed.

These roles and responsibilities were chosen keeping in mind what the group members were comfortable with, in the scope of the project. We also adjusted and refocused roles based on challenges being faced and strong personal qualities/traits present in each member.


#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the **purpose** of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be to-do lists, task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
