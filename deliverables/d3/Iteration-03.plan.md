# TEAM AWESOME



## Iteration 3

 * Start date: March 16 2017
 * End date: March 23 2017

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

* Creation of documentation
In our last iteration, we neglected the creation of documentation. We forgot 
to assign someone to oversee the upkeep of the Iteration-03.plan.md and 
Iteration-03.review.md documents. Angela volunteered to fulfill this role. 
Thus, we had to change Angela's role from soley backend role to a
backend/documentation role, and move some of her backend duties to Ishwant.
We had to move some of her backend duties to Ishwant because we realized
documentation is significant time commitment and also that documentation
is worth a considerable portion of our mark. Also, the other group
members will add to the plan and review documents as they see fit. 

We will use our mark on the plan and review documents as a success metric.

process.

* For this period, they will be concerned with the basic routing of the backend. This will include providing skeleton methods, connections to APIs, dummy inserts as well as beginning with the use of JDBC to connect the database.

**Frontend and Visuals:** Bence Linder, Shray Sharma

#### Artifacts

* Meeting minutes are kept for every meeting.
We review the meeting minutes from the previous meeting before
each new meeting to reorient ourselves with what needs to be done.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

* Each of our team members has their own branch forked from the
master repo.
* Pull requests are made between the prvivate repo of each member
and Ishwant's codebase.
* Ishwant oversees the pull requests.
* Ishwant reviews each pull request before he accepts it.
* By delegating the pull requests to Ishwant, we have successfully
avoided conflicts.
* Changes to documentation are committed directly to the master repo.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
