# TEAM 26 - Team AWESOME


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday 9 February 2017
 * Where: BA2195, Physical Meeting.

## Process - Reflection

We used this meeting to review what we discussed before add a few minor adjustments and get TA approval on our plans for the future. Additionally, we assigned roles and discussed that 3 intensive weeks of coding will begin immediately. At the end of the meeting we finalized all required documents for Friday submission. 

#### Decisions That Turned Out Well

 * Decided on layout, additional features and interface of the project. 
 * Assigned interim responsibilities to each group member. 
 * We picked a group leader, Jaleel Grant, who would oversee the completion of tasks and required components by deadlines as well as maintain cohesion among the group.
 * Finalized future meeting dates and deadlines. 

#### Decisions That Did not Turn Out As Qell As We Hoped

 * Initial decision to have field included in project has been removed.
 * It was decided that not using artifacts will not achieve the goal we were aiming for and so we developed and included artifacts in our plans for Team Deliverable 1.


#### Planned changes

 * We plan to meet on Sundays on Discord for 10 minutes to discuss completed assignments as well as discuss roadblocks and/or difficulties in completing tasks to allow for changes or help by other group members throughout the week. We made this change to prepare and manage any issues that may arise in development of the project. 
 * A change was decided on the home screen as well as functionality of some components in the project. It was determined that these changes would allow the project to attract and maintain its target audience as well as increase the importance and functionality.
 * It was also determined that our model of development will be the SCRUM method, making use of artifacts and roles as discussed.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or Tasks That Were Met/Completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Design mock-ups for submission.
 * Design intended interfaces and layouts.
 * Properly determine target audience. 
 * Completed requirements for Team Deliverable 1.
 * Outline future actions and activities for the upcoming week.

#### Goals and/or Tasks That Were Planned but Not Met/Completed:

 * Completion of the fields aspect of the project. It was determined that this would stray from the desired goal of the project and instead, if need after the main components were completed, would be re-discussed with respect to the target audience and, if necessary, added.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * We are going to start implementation immediately. We concluded that 1-3 weeks of intensive everyday coding and general development of the project would be more productive than 3+ weeks of lackadaisical development. It was determined that this would also complete the project quickly and leave more time for testing and tweaking as well as practice for the demo.
 * More meetings will be decided on and held in accordance with the progress being made every few days and the required deadlines.
 * We will use SCRUM method of development.
