Meeting Minutes

- Despite the fact that many group members had been busier than we anticipated, we 
managed to create the backend just in time
- We have a running server connected to a database 
- We are hosting the server on Heroku
- We still need to create the UI, which shouldn't take long
- We settled on FluidUI, which has a free version
- The ERD diagrams that had been assigned to our group member that dropped the course
has been reassigned to Jaleel.
- We have been using Facebook messenger to communicate. The group members prefer this 
to meeting in person.

To-do List 

- add github workflow (how useful it was, how it helped us[parllel programming])
- complete video for submission
- get minutes from today's meeting 
- finish setting up hosting of server on Heroku 
- submit and link all files 
- Find a way to work around FluidUI features, many of which aren't available in the free 
version
