## Individual Contributions

**Angela:** I used to be an English major, so writing is naturally my biggest strength. I took care of the documentation, and I took meeting minutes for each meeting. By doing this, I helped the group to organize their workflow. I also did some coding, creating some backend get requests and the first iteration of the frontend of the login page.

**Bence:** Front-end plan for both mobile and desktop versions of the webapp (only ended up implementing desktop version), as well as a mockup to use in the demo. I had little experience with node.js and html, so in the front-end design phase I took on other tasks while I learned what I could from our teamâ€™s implementation.

**Ishwant:** Worked with Jaleel to build the entire backend server including initial set-up, building a lot of routes, and connecting to the Cobalt API to populate our database

**Jaleel:** I worked on the backend along with Ishwant and Angela. We met occasionally and 
organized extreme code sprints to ensure that the maximum amount of work was done 
at every meeting. I worked on routes and designed the database and hosted it on Heroku.

**Parham:** I mainly worked on front-end implementation, working on implementing HTML5's geolocation API and writing some ajax calls to hook up backend features to front-end.

**Shray:** I was involved in pretty much every aspect of the front-end from writing page HTML structure and styling to the frontend JS scripts and backend/frontend integration through AJAX requests.
